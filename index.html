<h1>Silence Is Not the Enemy</h1>

<p>I know what I believe, but I don’t always feel the urgency to speak up about it on social media (at least, not anymore). However, I simply cannot ignore what’s happening, so this might be my last attempt at saying something. I hope you don’t misinterpret what I’m about to write. I’m trying to stand firm and not be tired or discouraged by everything going on. Despite my best effort, I <i>will</i> fall short, so please give this broken human some patience and grace. If that is not the case, I’m prepared to face whatever consequences might result in sharing these words.</p>

<p>Let me start by saying that <b>I’m honestly inspired by all of the bravery committed to fighting the evil that is so prevalent in our world.</b> And yet, I’m unreasonably afraid to do so myself. Afraid that I’ll say something wrong or the right thing in the wrong way. I feel like it is both my place to speak and my place to stay silent. If I courageously get up on my soapbox, will I become a clanging noise in the chaos (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13%3A1&version=NIV" target="_blank">1 Corinthians 13v1</a>)? Will I feel good about myself (which is not the goal)? Will I have a great sense of accomplishment and overwhelming validation from my followers (which is also not the goal)? Will I feel like I did my part in adding to the booming cries of anger against unlawful discrimination, betrayal, loss, and utter hatred? What exactly are my motives? What if I am riddled with fear, entitlement, pride, or a desire to feel accepted? What difference does it make? I suppose it does make a difference and we’ve seen it before, but at what costs?</p>

<p>I’m learning [<i>trying</i>] to bite my tongue. My spiritual temperament is social justice, so keeping silent is challenging and that’s an understatement. There’s a lot of things I deeply care about and racism is among them. I also have a righteous anger against many injustices including sex trafficking, fast fashion, and abortion. Agree to disagree on that last one, but I have meaningful contributions to the discussion, which I am willing to share privately. I will say this much though: those who are living have been blessed with the opportunity to do so. <b>Life is a basic human right and privilege we all take for granted. While we will inevitably face racism, war, inequality, and persecution, we’re at <i>least</i> given the chance to live in the first place.</b> I know what you might be thinking, “how dare she bring abortion into an argument about racism!” To clarify, I’m not. I see abortion and racism as two completly separate, yet equally important concerns and that’s my only point.</p>

<p>Please don’t get me wrong, I am not trying to belittle the real issue at hand. Racism is a grotesque and astronomical problem. Racism is absolutely incomparable to all the petty issues we complain about in our hearts daily. But there’s something I can’t shake—that glaring white saviorism staring me in the face. I’m worried that if I speak out against racism, I will be perceived as self-righteous: “Look at me, being such a good inclusive christian! You should all follow my example. If you don’t say anything, you’re just as bad as the racists themselves.” At the same time, I’ll be despised all the more by remaining silent. It’s a total catch-22. <b>If I keep quiet, I’ll appear to be protecting my own coveted self-image.</b> I’m just a privileged white American girl who desperately wants to believe my voice can save lives, but that’s foolishness. Jesus saves lives and I have a very small (if any) part to play in that process. By God’s grace, He might use me to save a life, but I am in utter submission to His will—whatever that may be.</p>

<p>If you speak against injustice, some may respect you, but if you speak incorrectly, people will resent you. My opinion has disowned me many times before, so I desire to give up internet controversies. I used to argue about almost anything: military spending, terrrorism, feminism, gun control, healthcare, common core, national security, recreational drugs, trafficking, birth control, abortion, you name it. By choosing to debate online, I have permanently lost friendships and I am not ok with that. I tried to speak in love and stand for truth simultaneously, but the web misconstrued my intentions. What good is my voice if it drives people away? Shouldn’t my words draw people closer to the heart of God? Wouldn’t it be a better use of my energy to simply love those around to me? To give everything I have to the people God has placed in my life rather than exhaust myself over patching up the holes in this world? <b>We were never meant to bear the weight of this burden.</b> Before the internet, our understanding of the world was so small and sometimes my heart longs for that simplicity. Perhaps it was just blissful ignorance and now we’re “enlightened.” Regardless of this knowledge, I <i>know</i> we aren’t designed to handle the responsibility of saving the world. That’s what Jesus died for. So what should be our position in all of this? I believe the answer can be found in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A14%E2%80%9321&version=NIV" target="_blank">Romans 12v14–21:</a>

<h2 style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:20%;">Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited. Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. <b>Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord.</b> On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</h2>
<p>Responding this way to brokeness is undeniably counter cultural to those who seek retribution. Instead of living to please others, I simply must “work heartily, as for the Lord” and do my best to give generously without boasting about it on social media (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A23%E2%80%9324&version=NIV" target="_blank">Colossians 3v23–24</a>). I know in my heart that I do not need recognition from man. Rather, I devote myself to “shining my light before others that they may see my good works, and glorify the Father in Heaven” and that’s all we can do (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A16&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 5v16</a>).</p> 
<p>I don’t want to make this about me. I want to advocate for what’s right and given the circumstances, demanding justice seems like the appropriate response. Even so, what if I’m wrong? What if love is not a megaphone shouting from the rooftops, but rather a whisper so close, it feels like a warm embrace? <b>Silence is not the enemy or the answer. Although it has the power to unite people, noise can just as easily drive them apart. Aggression and violence will only cause further destruction. Love however, draws people in.</b> Maybe getting back to the garden looks a lot more like peace with everyone (including racists) in lieu of stirring up anger (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+4%3A1&version=NIV" target="_blank">James 4v1</a>). Nonetheless, peace is no excuse for complacency. A passive life is an easy escape, but it cannot substitute conviction. I believe racism is wrong and if you want to talk about it over coffee, I would be honored. Social media should be a platform that’s meant for encouraging and building one another up (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A11&version=NIV" target="_blank">1 Thessalonians 5v11</a>). It’s not the source of our identity—it’s an opportunity for community. And when the time is right and you’ve put in the hard work to love someone well, God <i>will</i> give you opportunities to share your convictions with them and for the first time, they’ll listen (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13%3A8-14&version=NIV" target="_blank">Romans 13v8–14</a>).
